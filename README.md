LSTM is a type of RNN architecture. It excels at processing sequential data, such as text. LSTMs use specialized memory cells to capture and remember long-term dependencies in data, thereby avoiding the vanishing gradient problem. This makes them suitable for text generation tasks because they can learn and retain contextual information over long sequences, resulting in coherent and contextually relevant textual output.
